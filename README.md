# VaR-Optimization-Using-Quantile-Regression

---

Value at risk (VaR) is a very useful tool to quantify extreme losses. There are many different methodologies to forecast value at risk. However, those methodologies always produce widely different VaR forecasts. In this paper, we try to combine some frequently used VaR forecasts by penalized quantile regression. We randomly choose 30 stocks from SP500 to form a equally weighted portfolio. Then we compare penalized quantile regression with other standalone VaR methods as well as two combination methods(Simple average and unpenalized quantile regression). To evaluate different forecasts methods, we perform backtesting using unconditional coverage test and conditional coverage test. The results show that penalized quantile regressions perform better than standalone methods.
